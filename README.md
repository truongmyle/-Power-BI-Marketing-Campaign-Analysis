## 🔎 Insights & Recommendation  

### 1. Insights
- **By Time (Monthly Trends)**
    - ROI spiked between June–August (~13) but dropped sharply in September (~7.7).
    - Despite higher impressions in September, engagement rate decreased → reach quality declined.
- **By Channel**
    - **Pinterest**: Highest ROI and conversion rate → clear driver of efficiency.
    - **Instagram**: Balanced performance, moderate ROI.
    - **Facebook**: Significant investment but low ROI → weak conversion effectiveness.
- **By City**
    - **Birmingham**: Strong ROI, especially from Pinterest campaigns.
    - **Manchester**: Underperforming ROI despite decent impressions.
    - **London**: High spend but weak ROI → potential inefficiency.
### 2. Recommendations
- **Budget Optimization**
    - Shift budget from **Facebook (low ROI)** to **Pinterest (high ROI & CR)**.
    - Keep limited Facebook budget for awareness only → avoid waste.
    - Test new audience targeting and creatives on Instagram for potential uplift.
- **Communication Strategy**
    - **Pinterest**: Scale further as main conversion channel.
    - **Facebook**: Use as **top-of-funnel (awareness)**, integrate with retargeting on Pinterest/Instagram.
    - **Instagram**: Use for both awareness and conversion experiments.
- **City-level Actions**
    - **Birmingham**: Expand Pinterest campaigns to maximize strong ROI.
    - **Manchester**: Refresh creatives/targeting to improve performance.
    - **London**: Audit conversion funnel → if ROI remains low, reduce budget allocation.
- **Tables**: Consistent losses → discontinue or implement new pricing strategy.
- **Canon Copier**: High return rate → investigate and address quality/operational issues.
